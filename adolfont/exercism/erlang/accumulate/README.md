# Accumulate

Implement the `accumulate` operation, which, given a collection and an
operation to perform on each element of the collection, returns a new
collection containing the result of applying that operation to each element of
the input collection.

Given the collection of numbers:

- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

And the operation:

- square a number (`x => x * x`)

Your code should be able to produce the collection of squares:

- 1, 4, 9, 16, 25

Check out the test suite to see the expected function signature.

## Restrictions

Keep your hands off that collect/map/fmap/whatchamacallit functionality
provided by your standard library!
Solve this one yourself using other basic tools instead.

## Running tests

In order to run the tests, issue the following command from the exercise
directory:

For running the tests provided, `rebar3` is used as it is the official build and
dependency management tool for erlang now. Please refer to [the tracks installation
instructions](http://exercism.io/languages/erlang/installation) on how to do that.

In order to run the tests, you can issue the following command from the exercise
directory.

```bash
$ rebar3 eunit
```
