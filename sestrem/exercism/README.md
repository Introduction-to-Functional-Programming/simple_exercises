> Solid solution.

> Elixir string handling is odd. Elixir has its own version of a string which is handled by the String module. There's also the charlist, which Elixir has because it's built on Erlang and in Erlang, strings are charlists. Elixir can utilize Erlang libraries and therefore we need to know how to process charlists. Charlists can also come in handy for certain types of processing which you'll discover further down the Elixir track.

> Instead of converting to a string and back to a charlist, see if you can refactor this to transform the input charlist directly to an output charlist. Check out this link about charlists and this one about the codepoint operator if you're not sure where to start.

> Another good resource for charlists is an iex session. Fire one up on your machine (or try this online version...type iex in the terminal on the right to get started), then type [67, 65, 84] on the command line and enter it and see if you get back what you expected.

> This charlist repl can also be useful.

> Definitely ask me if you have any questions.
